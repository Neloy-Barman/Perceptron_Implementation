Perceptron implementation steps: - 
1. Read the data from a txt file & prepared the dataframe.
2. Plot the datapoints.
3. Preapare the phi function.
4. Normalizing a class.
5. Activation with weight.
6. Check if misclassification occurs.
7. Find the misclassified indexes.
8. Update Weights.
9. A batch & single perceptron consisting of all the functionalities.
10. Passing different learning rates & weights to check which converges faster.
